Here is the step by step documentation to install Jeedom on most linux systems (based on debian)

[IMPORTANT]
Debian 8 or Ubuntu 15.04 recommended

=== Etape 1 : Ssh connection

First you must log in ssh on your linux. And update the following: 

----
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get install -y curl wget
----

=== Etape 2 : Launch the installation script

Here are 3 commands to start installation of Jeedom : 

----
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeedom/core/stable/install/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
----

=== Etape 3 : Installation

Nothing special here simply answer questions. This step can take up to 30 min. Here are the details :

The installer warns you if nginx is already installed it will overwrite the default configuration, simply type "yes" then input :

This screen appears only if you have never installed mysql on your machine, give it a password (beware it's the password "root" mysql we must remember it) :

Retype the same password to confirm :

Here restore the previous password, and confirm (on the capture the password is "jeedom"):

That installation is complete, the installer gives you the URL to connect to Jeedom (watch it changes according to the facilities) and the default password (admin/admin)

=== Etape 4 : Setting root access to Jeedom

This step will allow Jeedom to have more rights and therefore to be able for example to switch off and restart, or manage the networks for example.

sudo su -
echo "www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" | (EDITOR="tee -a" visudo)
